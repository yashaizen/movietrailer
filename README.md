# Working
The Program "entertainment_center.py" takes the data for movies . Each movie data is assigned to an Instance which uses the class "Movie" and is imported with the file 'media.py' . media.py acts as a constructor for the variables inside the Instance.
Finally all the instances are added into a list 'movies'.
The program then uses the function "open_movies_page()" which is defined inside the file "fresh_tomatoes.py". This function takes the list 'movies' as its argument and generates a webpage of our data, it also opens the browser with our generated webpage on it.
